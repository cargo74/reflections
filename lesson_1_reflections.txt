Q:How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see 
the bug that was introduced?

A:Viewing a diff between the old file and the new file enabled me to 
focus solely on the lines which were different.

Q:How do you like the Sublime text editor?
A:Well enough, so far. This text editor does not automatically insert line breaks. I must remem
ber to insert them myself.

Q:How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make 
you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A:Easily backtrack to an earlier, working version.
I don't have a very confident answer for this.

Q:How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the 
history of files?
A: git log allows me to see the commit history of the repository.
git diff compares two files for changes. It displays the file content
with red text indicating a line removed from the old version. Lines added
in the new version are shown in green.

Q:How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that could break something?
A:As long as the commits are appropriately sized, and the problem is
identified rapidly, there are two options for dealing witha bug. Git 
allows a fast analysis of past commits to identify when an error may have 
been made. Git makes it a simple matter to revert to an earlier version
rather than try to fix the bug.

Q:Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try 
using Git for?
A:I want to develop a google search front end for dvorak keyboardists who
find themselves on a qwerty keyboard
