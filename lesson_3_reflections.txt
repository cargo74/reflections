Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:To share changes with other people

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:Others may push ambigous changes to the remote. This could be confusing.

Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
A:Fork is used to clone a github repository in order to maintain a link back to the original.
Clone is used to clone any repository (local or remote). No link is retained
back to the original. It might be used to create a brand new project from a known start.
Branch is used to split off from the production code in order to develop a large
or experimental change.

Q:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
locally?
A:Enables me to detect when the remote has changed. Enables me to revert to the 
earlier  state if reuired

Q:When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than 
directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A:When collaborating with a larger team, branching code to pursue specific goals
then later merging with master makes more sense. It enable collaborative
decision-making about what features and fixes to include in  the Master.
In a small team, the overhead may be unnecessary, so I would just work directly
in the master.
