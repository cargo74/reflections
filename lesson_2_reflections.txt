Q:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A:Hidden .git directory is created with all the necessary files for keeping
track of file revisions.

Q:How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
A:The staging area contains a list of files which are being tracked
and will be committed on the next commit.
This is valuable because it makes it clear what will be committed and
provides a siimple mechanism for removiing files from the commmit.
